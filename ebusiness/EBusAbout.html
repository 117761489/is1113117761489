            Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides a virtualized computing resource over the internet.
            In IaaS, a cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components that traditionally present in an on-premise data center which would 
            include servers, storage, networking hardware and the virtualization components. An example of IaaS is
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg">Amazon Web Services(AWS)</a>(a Subsidiary of Amazon.com), which provides on- demand 
            cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments, on a paid subscription basis. It allows subscribers to
            have a fully-fledged virtual cluster of computers available through thee internet. The browser acts as a virtual computer, 
            letting users log-in and use their virtual systems just as they would a real computer.

            of storage. Users can receive emails up to 50 megabytes in size, including attachments, while they can send emails up to 25 megabytes. 
            In order to send larger files, users can insert files from Google Drive into the message.
